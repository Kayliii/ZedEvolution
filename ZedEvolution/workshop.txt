description=[*]The "Evolution Factor" setting determines the overall pace of evolution. Setting it to 1 makes evolution take place over the course of about a month.
description=[*]The "Evolution Delay" setting will start a countdown of however many days are entered there and start evolution after that. This number can be negative to make evolution begin before the game starts.
description=[*]The "Starting Progression" setting will preemptively apply the given number of days worth of evolution as a baseline. This number can be negative to make zombies start "devolved" compared to the provided settings.
description=[*]Zombie population growth is already possible using the vanilla settings, so this mod does not have any custom settings for it.

description=[h3]Attributes[/h3]
description=[list]
description=[*]All vanilla zombie lore settings are treated as baseline attributes. When the evolution of your world is 0 (usually at the beginning), they will behave according to those settings. Any settings that are set to "Random" are unaffected by evolution.
description=[*]Attribute caps indicate how much stronger or weaker zombies can become compared to their baseline.
description=[*]Individual attributes can be customized using their multipliers. A multiplier of 0 means the attribute never changes. >0 means zombies become better at it. <0 means zombies become worse at it. The greater the number, the quicker they evolve.
description=[*]Transmission evolves from "None" -> "Blood" -> "Blood + Saliva". It does not progress towards "Everyone's Infected."
